*Rolling a one on an armor save or magic save have different results depending on the initial effect. If the effect is just damage, then they take the Full Damage from that attack and that damage cannot be healed magically and will only return after the affected PC/NPC/Creature takes a short rest (10 minutes). If the effect is anything other than damage, then they take the Full Effect from that attack and then the affected PC/NPC/Creature will also take on the haken condition until they take a short rest (10 minutes).
